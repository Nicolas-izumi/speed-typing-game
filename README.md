### game rules
---
The objective is too type as many word as you can in 60s.
You must type the word that are shown on the screen. If you write it false, what you typed will be shown in red and then deleted after 1s. If it's correct, it asks you the next question.
After 60s passt, you won't be able to go to the next question, it will be the end of the game.
### code and execution
---
The program is written in python.
If you don't know how to execute python, I'll show you:
In the terminal or the command prompt, write: `python` + `PATH TO THE PYTHON FILE`.
If python isn't installed, install python.

### bugs in the code
The program use `tkinter`, `threading` and `time`.
If you haven't them installed install them with `pip install` + `NAME OF THE LIBRAIRIE`.
If you are so fast that you did all the word before the 60 seconds passt, it will create an error `list out of range`.
I continue to upgrade the code.
