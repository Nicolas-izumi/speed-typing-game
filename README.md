### game rules
---
The objective is too type as many word as you can in 60s.
You must type the word that are shown on the screen. If you write it false, what you typed will be shown in red and then deleted after 1s. If it's correct, it asks you the next question.
After 60s passt, you won't be able to go to the next question, it will be the end of the game.

### code and execution
---
The program is written in python.
If you don't know how to execute python, I'll show you:
In the terminal or the command prompt, write: `python` + `PATH TO THE PYTHON FILE`.
If python isn't installed, install python.

I also created am `.exe` file but because python is more stable, I recommend you to use python.

### bugs in the code
---
The program use `tkinter`, `threading` and `time`.
If you haven't them installed install them with `pip install` + `NAME OF THE LIBRAIRIE`.
If you are so fast that you did all the word before the 60 seconds passt, it will create an error `list out of range`.

---
If you did something wrong on your computer, it's your problem. I published just my own program and I won't resolve problem of others.
If you see a bug, you can say it to me but it's not sure that I could resolve it.

---
*I will continue to upgrade the code*
